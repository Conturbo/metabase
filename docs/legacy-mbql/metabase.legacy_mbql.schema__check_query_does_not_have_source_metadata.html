columns in the source query.</p>
<p>Where this is added was changed in Metabase 0.33.0 -- previously, when <code>card__id</code> source queries were resolved, the
middleware would add <code>:source-metadata</code> to the top-level; to support joins against source queries, this has been
changed so it is always added at the same level the resolved <code>:source-query</code> is added.</p>
<p>This should automatically be fixed by <code>normalize</code>; if we encounter it, it means some middleware is not functioning
properly.</p>
